# Changelog

## [1.2.1] - 2026-09-06

### Added
- `themeTools.addThemeColor` now covers now also checks if a stack has a contrasting background (compared to a slide only). 
- Navigating can change the background without changing any class on the deck, so `slidechanged` is listened to as well.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- `themeTools.addThemeColor(deck)`. It keeps `--c-theme-color` and `--c-theme-heading-color`  (based on the text/title color inside the slides) on the viewport, and adds the class `c-theme-inverted` there if a slide’s background contrasts the theme. Any plugin that styles elements outside of the `.slides` element can now use those colors.
- The measuring happens once per deck. Any plugin may call it, and later calls get the same colours back.
- `RevealInstance` gained `getRevealElement()`.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- A `csspath` that loads while a stylesheet for the plugin is already on the page now adds a warning to the console. `csspath` adds a stylesheet, but it cannot take one away. The deck still looks styled, so nothing reported this before. It is a bundler case. A plugin's own `import` of its stylesheet is invisible to the toolkit. A dev server then shows the plugin's defaults on top of the author's file (a build shows only the author's). The warning says what it found: a tagged `<link>`, or an import.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed
- The once-per-deck guards added in 1.1.1 did not work across plugins, which is the case they existed for. Plugins bundle the toolkit rather than sharing one instance. The mark now goes on the deck itself under a `Symbol.for` key, which every copy in the page resolves to the same symbol.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-24

### Changed
- `RevealInstance` is a structural interface in `src/types.ts` rather than an alias for a reveal.js type: `Api` is from `@types/reveal.js` (4.x, 5.x) and `RevealApi` from reveal.js 6's own typings, so importing either pins the toolkit to one generation and breaks types for the others. `@types/reveal.js` is no longer a devDependency.
- A cleanup from `addScrollModeEvents` is inert unless it came from the call that installed the observer, so if one plugin shuts down, then the events stay up for the rest.

### Added
- `PluginInit`, and `RevealSlideEvent` from the package root.
- `test/event-tools.test.mjs`, run by `npm test`.

### Fixed
- `addDirectionEvents` and `addScrollModeEvents` installed a dispatcher per caller, so if two plugins asked for the same deck-wide events, then every one fired twice. They now install once per deck. `addDirectionEvents` still returns `void`: nothing stops wanting these, and they survive `destroy()`.
- The missing-viewport warning now says said `[plugintoolkit]`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-23

- CSS loading is one decision now, taken from three inputs: whether the stylesheet is already on the page, what the author asked for, and whether the plugin's own file has a URL to resolve a path against. The environment flags no longer take part in it.

### Fixed
- A `csspath` that fails is always reported.
- A `console.warn` when no more options to get the path
- A stylesheet sitting **beside** the plugin script is now found.
- The options-object form (`pluginCSS({ id, … })`) consults the `--cssimported-<id>` marker like everything else.

### Added
- `pluginCSS` returns `{ status, path? }` — `present`, `loaded`, `skipped`, `advised` or `failed`. A plugin that reads colours or sizes back off the page can wait for the stylesheet instead of racing it.
- `cssautoload` accepts `'auto'`, which is exactly the same as leaving it out: decide for me. `true` still forces the standard paths to be tried even where nothing can be derived.
- `whenThemeApplied(timeout)` and `isThemeApplied()`. Every Reveal theme declares `--r-main-color` and `reveal.css` does not, so this is proof a theme has been *applied* rather than requested — for plugins that read theme colours at startup.
- `warnOnce(pluginId, message)` for advisories that must reach people who never switch `debug` on.
- Shared helpers that were being copied between plugins, and had already started to drift: `isJSON` and `toJSONString` (`configTools`), `copyDataAttributes` and `createNode` (`domTools`), `sanitizeText` (`textTools`).
- `checkCssImported(pluginId)` is exported: the same marker test the toolkit uses, answered immediately rather than waited on.
- `"sideEffects": false`, so a bundler drops the helpers a plugin does not use.

### Changed
- `isBundled` is now `hasResolvableSource`, inverted — the name states the test rather than a conclusion. A dev server has no resolvable source either, without being a bundle. `findPluginSource` returns `{ directory: string | null }`.
- `EnvironmentInfo.isDevelopment`, `.hasHMR` and `.isViteDev` are deprecated. Nothing in the toolkit reads them; they were proxies for "can a path be resolved", and being poor proxies for it is what kept this area moving between 1.0.0 and 1.0.8.
- The bundler advisory names the import that would fix it, rather than saying "import the CSS manually" without saying from where.

### Deprecated, still working
`isPluginBundled`, `findPluginScriptSource` and `findPluginScriptPath` are kept for 1.0.x callers.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-08-21
### Changed
- Using an observer instead of waiting to check for the load of CSS through the (--cssimported-*) marker. 
- Warning in console only if you (the user) has set an own path.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-08-06
### Fixed
- Environment detection no longer goes through `new Function(...)`. A function body is always parsed in non-module goal, so `Function("return import.meta")` threw a `SyntaxError` at parse time in every environment, not just in UMD. As a result `isDevelopment` was permanently `false`, CSS autoloading never switched itself off in bundler environments, and the "import the CSS manually" warning was unreachable.
- `import.meta` is now referenced directly so each output format can handle it: the ESM build keeps `import.meta.url`, the UMD build has it replaced with `{}` and falls back to `document.currentScript`.
- Each environment probe sits in its own `try` block, so a failing probe can no longer discard the result of another.
- Removing the last `Function()` call also makes detection work under a Content Security Policy without `unsafe-eval`.

### Changed
- CSS autoloading is now decided by whether the plugin was loaded as a file of its own, not by HMR sniffing. Loading via `<script src>`, via `<script type="module">import</script>` and inside an application bundle are all told apart without bundler-specific globals.
- `EnvironmentInfo` gained `isBundled`, and `detectEnvironment` takes an optional plugin id to fill it in.
- The "CSS autoloading is disabled" warning is only shown when the toolkit made that call itself, not when `cssautoload` was explicitly set to `false`.
- `types` in package.json now points at `dist/src/index.d.ts`, which is where the declarations are actually emitted. It pointed at `dist/index.d.ts`, so consumers got no types at all.
